    "- All collections extend the ```Iterable``` trait. \n",
    "- The three major categories of collections are sequences, sets, and maps.\n",
    "- Scala has mutable and immutable versions of most collections.\n",
    "- A Scala list is either empty, or it has a head and a tail which is again a list.\n",
    "- Sets are unordered collections.\n",
    "- Use a ```LinkedHashSet``` to retain the insertion order or a ```SortedSet``` to iterate in sorted order.\n",
    "- + adds an element to an unordered collection; +: and :+ prepend or append to a sequence; ++ concatenates two collections; - and -- remove elements\n",
    "- The ```Iterable``` and ```Seq``` traits have dozens of useful methods for common operations. Check them out before writing tedious loops.\n",
    "- Mapping, folding, and zipping are useful techniques for applying a function or operation to the elements of a collection. "
