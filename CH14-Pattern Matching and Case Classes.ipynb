    "- Case classes are a special kind of classes that are optimized for use in pattern matching. \n",

    "When you declare a case class, several things happen automatically.\n",
    "- Each of the constructor parameters becomes a ```val``` unless it is explicitly declared as a ```var``` (which is not recommended)\n",

    "- An ```unapply``` method is provided that makes pattern matching work.\n",
    "- Methods ```toString, equals, hashCode, and copy``` are generated unless they are explicity provided. "
